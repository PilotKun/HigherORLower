fix: Improve browser automation reliability and connection handling

This commit addresses several issues with the browser automation and connection handling:

1. Browser Connection Improvements:
- Disabled proxy settings to prevent localhost connection timeouts
- Added browser options to improve connectivity and stability:
  * --no-proxy-server: Disables proxy usage
  * --disable-gpu: Prevents GPU-related issues
  * --disable-dev-shm-usage: Improves memory handling
  * --ignore-certificate-errors: Handles SSL issues
  * --disable-web-security: Reduces connection restrictions
  * --allow-running-insecure-content: Improves content loading

2. Timeout and Error Handling:
- Reduced page load timeout from 120s to 30s for faster failure detection
- Added page refresh fallback when initial navigation fails
- Improved error logging and recovery mechanisms

3. XPath and Element Interaction:
- Reverted to absolute XPaths for more reliable element location
- Maintained improved element waiting logic for better stability
- Added explicit waits for elements to be both present and clickable

4. Code Structure:
- Enhanced error handling in browser initialization
- Added better logging for debugging purposes
- Improved code organization in browser_handler.py

These changes should resolve the connection timeout issues and improve the overall reliability of the browser automation process.
